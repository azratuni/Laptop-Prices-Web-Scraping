# Laptop-Prices-Web-Scraping
I scraped laptop prices from 2 websites using Python, BeautifulSoup, Requests

A combined dataset namely "LaptopPrices" has been created with the data scraped off two websites (Ryans Computers and Star Tech). The dataset has 621 observations/ rows and 6 columns ["Product Name", "Processor Type", "RAM", "Storage", "Display", "Price"]

The cleaned dataset, "LaptopPrices_CleanData" has 7 columns ["Product Name", "Processor Type", "RAM", "Storage", "Display", "Price", "Brand"]

The dataset is available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/azratuni/laptop-prices-bdt-currency
